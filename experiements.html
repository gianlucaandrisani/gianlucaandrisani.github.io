            <h2 class="sololui">Experiments</h2>
            <p>
                Through the skills learnt from the VR mobile apps online course emitted 
                from San Diego University that I pursued in November, I applied my knowledge 
                in some experiments with AR and VR mobile applications.

                I decided to go through this path in order to understand how users interact with 
                immersive digital systems and to find the right solutions for them in order to refine 
                and make more spontaneous the interaction between human and digital worlds.

            <h2>Interactable 3D System.</h2>
            <p>I built this interactable experience, as so it was brought through the cardboard the 
                interaction system was built all over the gazesystem, which I programmed in C# in order to 
                activate and create an actual Gaze Interaction System with the main menu and actions and game 
                elements to interact with.

            <h2>Augmented experiences</h2>
            <p>Always using Unity and its plugins I developed then some Augmented Reality products, 
                in order to show some products or to create immersive and weird real world experiences.

            <p>The aim of the Hackathon was to find a solution in order to ease their rapport between Gen Z and the Insurance Companies.

                We worked on this project for SV Informatik, we oly had three days and the team was made by Myself, 
                federica from Barcellona and Anuschka from New York.
            </p>
            <img src="svinfo.png" alt="" class="flow1">
            <p>We thought about offering a service of Insurance for the peopleâ€™s tech devices and social 
                identities, in order to always make them feel safe and not being uncovered for their online and influencer business.</p>


            <h2>StartHack '22, St. Gallen, Switzerland.</h2>
            <p>During this Hackathon I had the opportunity to know and meet such interesting people, but most of all to work with an 
                international team coming from different backgrounds in order to build a complete product for Microsoft in 36 hours. <br>
                <br>
                It was extremely challenging and stimulating to collaborate with people coming from completely different parts of the world, 
                such as India or Germany, speaking only english as work language.

            <h2>Different roles, same goals.</h2>
            <p>I had the opportunity to collaborate with people with different responsabilities, such as software engineering or front 
                end developing, opening my eyes on the difficulties on developing comples UIs and how to structure a better engineering hand-off.
