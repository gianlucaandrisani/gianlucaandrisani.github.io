                It is required to design a system / service / product that exploiting the IoT technologies developed by
                STMicroelectronics can solve problems and / or improve existing solutions related to
                following areas: <br>
                - Well-being of the person <br>
                - Disability <br>
                - Living comfort <br>

        <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
        <div Class="problem">
            <p>Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by the presence of high levels blood glucose
                (hyperglycemia) and due to an altered quantity or function of insulin.

                Insulin is the hormone produced by the pancreas that allows glucose to enter cells and its consequent
                use as an energy source.
                When this mechanism is altered, glucose accumulates in the bloodstream
            </p>
            <div class="daico">
                <h3 class="amme">Diabetes Type 1</h3>
                <p>It affects about 10% of people with diabetes and generally occurs in childhood or adolescence.
                    In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not produce insulin due to the destruction of the ß cells that
                    produce this hormone:
                    it therefore needs to be injected every day and for life.</p>

        <h2>Interviews</h2>
        <div class="scheme">
            <img src="quidinter.png" alt="">
            <p>To better understand our user and their needs related to this discomfort, we wrote a long script of 2 hour 
                long interview questions, which we asked to 6 people with type 1 diabetes.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Persona</h2>
        <p>Thanks to the interviews conducted to the parents as well, we've been able to build our user persona.</p>

        <h2>Customer Journey</h2>

        <div>
            <p>Then we tried to understand Susannas’s struggles using a 
                Customer Journey, understanding that the main problems are:

        <h2>User flows.</h2>

        <div>
            <p>In order to understand which were the most important things for a diabetes patient,
                 we built the user flows to reach the most important actions and informations immediatly, effortless and safely.

                This user flows where built with the aid of the users, asking them what were they expecting from the app and the interaction from it.
            </p>
            <img src="user flow1.png" alt="" class="flow1">
            <p>This user flow maps all the possibilities that the user has once opened the application, 
                hving everything under control he will be able to check his glicemic status at first, and also to check 
                the condition of his product. With this method, the user has the most important informatio navailable at first sight.
            </p>
            <img src="userflow2.png" class="flow2">
            <p>This user flow instead explores the other most important feature of our product, within thw food section, the user will be able to 
                inject the right amount of insulin, and will also get aid from the system itself.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>

        <div class="IA">
            <p> Starting from the information architecture,I developed the wireframed app, without never forgetting 
                the medical aim of the project, how should the user feel and what his he expecting to find.
            </p>

        <h2>UI Elements</h2>

        <div class="UIelements">
            <p>We wanted the user to feel relaxed and carefree, but at the same time safe and in a secure environment, 
                where he can always have things under control in ordeer to easily manage his disease.

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>

        <div>
            <p>We decided to get inspired from organic forms in order to design a solution that would mimic the human body.
            </p>
            <img src="quidinspo.png" alt="" class="inspo">
        </div>


        <h2>Human Body Extension</h2>

        <div>
            <p>Our studies allowed us to design and test this organic form that become an extension of the human body.

        <h2>Safe, Flexible,Decomposable.</h2>

        <div>
            <p>Quid offers a totally flexible system, which adapts to the user’s needs and behaviors, 
                decomposable in different rechargable parts so the user can reuse them and not be forced to trash the 
                whole product with the technology inside.

        <h2>Safety Protocol for any situation</h2>

        <div>
            <p>We studied a detailed safety protocol that only actiates if and when the product detects a worrying data of the user’s insulin status.
            </p>

        <h2>Quid does it all</h2>

        <div>
            <p>From the food section, Quid will also take care about what you’re eating, in order to suggest you the right amount of doses to inject.

        <h2>Designed for and with the users.</h2>

        <div>
            <p>We involved diabetic patients in our design process for the most harsh and important choices we made, 
                it was a very delicate project and we wanted to design things with sense and that could actually change some people’s lives.
