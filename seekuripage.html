        <h2>Information Architecture</h2>

        <div class="IA">
            <p>In order to structure the application we went through the information architecture process, 
                with the aim to understand which were the most importart features and sections for the user to reach.
                A tab bar navigation was the chosen rapresentation, in order that the user could access easily to all 
                the informations present in the app.

                communicating with the product and the child.

            <p>Once the wireframes were confirmed by the final user, I went through the UI defining process, 
                defining its elements and interaction based on IOS phones.
